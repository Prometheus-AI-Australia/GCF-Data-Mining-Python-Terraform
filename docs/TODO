Prototype:
    [X] Collect orderbook data @done(21-01-06 13:07)
    [X] Collect candlestick data @done(21-01-06 18:11)
    [X] Deploy application using Terraform. @started(21-01-06 13:08) @done(21-01-06 14:48) @lasted(1h40m54s)
    [ ] Fill out README.md

MVP:
    [ ] Log application information for debugging etc.
    [ ] End2End test application using pytest.
    [ ] Extend documentation to explain and point to the technologies used, etc.
    [X] Build a SA diagram using diagrams package. @done(21-01-06 17:39)

Extensions:
    [ ] Setup CI/CD pipeline

Fixes:
    [ ] Use Terraform workspaces to manage two different set of states.
        Maybe this isn't such a big deal? Realistically, you'd want a completely
        fresh copy of the source (such as a CI/CD pipeline) and it wouldn't 
        even know that there is another backend state.
    [ ] Correct integration test for `test_collect_candlesticks`

Improvements:
    [ ] Refactor Terraform to use a module for the function for reusability / extendability.
    [ ] Unit test individual classes used in the application.
